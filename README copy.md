Data Collections and Recommended Visualizations
Message Types and Categories

Data Attributes: type, categories
Chart Type: Pie Chart or Donut Chart
Details: Displays the distribution of message types (Body Language, Light Signals, etc.) and main categories (CO, NP, SE, etc.). This gives users a high-level overview of the variety in message content.
Interactivity: Users can hover over each slice for message counts and click to filter the dashboard by type or category.
Message Counts by Encoders and Decoders

Data Attributes: messageEncoder, messageDecoder
Chart Type: Stacked Bar Chart
Details: Illustrates how often each encoder (e.g., Diver, Surface Attendant) and decoder are associated with messages, showing typical communication flows between roles.
Interactivity: Users can click on specific bars to isolate messages associated with each encoder-decoder pairing.
Message Distribution by Context

Data Attributes: spatialContext, temporalContext
Chart Type: Grouped Bar Chart
Details: Compares message use in different spatial (Colocated) and temporal (Synchronous) contexts. Users can quickly see the distribution across various contexts, aiding in understanding how communication is contextualized.
Interactivity: Toggle between spatial and temporal filters to view context-specific communication breakdowns.
Hierarchical Breakdown of Message Types and Subcategories

Data Attributes: type, categories, message
Chart Type: Tree Map or Sunburst Chart
Details: Hierarchically displays messages within each type and subcategory, giving an overview of how each message category expands into specific messages.
Interactivity: Allows drill-down into each type, revealing message details at the leaf level (e.g., exact message content and variations).
Message and Context Heatmap

Data Attributes: type, spatialContext, temporalContext
Chart Type: Heatmap
Details: A density view showing how different message types correlate with specific spatial and temporal contexts. This chart highlights high-frequency combinations, such as Body Language signals used in colocated, synchronous settings.
Interactivity: Clicking on a cell reveals a modal with message descriptions and usage statistics in that context. Hovering displays counts, helping users find dominant communication patterns.
Message Variations Analysis

Data Attributes: message, messageVariations
Chart Type: Bubble Chart
Details: Highlights the range of variations available for each message, with bubble size indicating the number of variations for each primary message. This visualization helps users identify messages with extensive alternative expressions.
Interactivity: Hovering over a bubble shows each message's primary content and variations, while clicking isolates the message for further exploration.
Reference Count per Message

Data Attributes: references, message
Chart Type: Horizontal Bar Chart
Details: Shows the count of references for each message, offering insight into which messages are more frequently backed by research sources.
Interactivity: Users can hover over each bar to see specific reference details and click to filter messages by selected references. This can be particularly useful for users interested in source-backed data.
Category Breakdown by Meaning

Data Attributes: categories, meaning
Chart Type: Tree Map or Treemap Hierarchy
Details: Represents each category’s breakdown by its associated meanings. For example, messages in the SE (Safety Equipment) category can be organized by their meanings to show the diversity in usage.
Interactivity: Clicking on a cell shows the list of messages in the selected meaning group, while hovering reveals more information about that meaning.
Sentiment or Purpose of Messages

Data Attributes: meaning, description
Chart Type: Word Cloud
Details: A word cloud of terms in meaning and description helps users quickly see the most common terms associated with different messages. This visual gives a general sense of the messages' thematic focus.
Interactivity: Clicking on a word filters messages associated with that term, while hovering shows the frequency of each term.
Implementation Considerations
Filtering and Drill-downs: Dynamic filters allow users to adjust contextually across attributes, enabling real-time updates of all charts based on selected parameters. Each chart can contribute to a cohesive, filterable dashboard view.
Hover and Click Interactivity: Each chart would use tooltips to show detailed counts or descriptions, and clicking elements would drill down to finer details or isolate specific data for a deeper view.
Library Choice: Plotly and D3.js are well-suited for these visualizations, offering flexible options for drill-down and hover interactivity that would work seamlessly with SvelteKit.

To design a dynamic dashboard without list or network views, we can use various types of charts and tables to represent the data interactively. Here’s a plan tailored to your requirements:

Dynamic Dashboard Features:
Category Distribution:

Bar Chart or Pie Chart: Show the distribution of messages across categories (e.g., Coordination, Safety & Emergency).
Category Interactions:

Heatmap: Display the intensity of relationships between categories (e.g., Coordination vs. Safety & Emergency).
Message Analysis:

Dynamic Data Table: Filter and explore messages by category, message type, and context.
Temporal and Spatial Context:

Scatter Plot: Visualize messages categorized by temporalContext and spatialContext.
Action-Based Insights:

Stacked Bar Chart: Breakdown of actions by message type (e.g., body language, light signals).



Steps to Build the Dashboard
1. Data Preparation
Load the JSON data in your Next.js project.
Use a utility function to process and group data based on relationships.
2. Dynamic Charts
Bar Chart (React Chart.js or Recharts): Show the distribution of messages across categories.
Example: Number of messages in each category.
Pie Chart: Proportion of messages by categories like Safety & Emergency and Coordination.
Heatmap (React Chart.js): Display category interaction intensity.
3. Dynamic Tables
Use React Table to build sortable, filterable tables.
Include columns for message, category, type, temporalContext, and spatialContext.
4. Interactive Filters
Use ShadCN UI components (like select menus and sliders) for filters.
Filters could include:
Categories (single or multiple selection).
Temporal and spatial context filters.
Message type filters (e.g., Body Language, Light Signals).
5. Dashboard Layout
Use ShadCN UI grid system or cards for organizing charts and tables.
Ensure responsiveness and a seamless user experience.

To explain how each detail from the data.json file is utilized in the processData.tsx file:

ID: Each message has a unique ID to track specific data entries. In the processData.tsx, it can be used to uniquely identify and manage each signal within the application.

Message and Variations: The main message and its variations provide the primary communication signals (e.g., "OK", "Stop"). These are likely used to render text or provide multiple matching options for user inputs in the processData.tsx.

Description: This explains how a signal is performed, providing a visual or procedural guide. The file may use this for user education or guidance.

Meaning: The meaning explains the intent behind each signal, critical for ensuring correct interpretation in the application.

Encoders and Decoders: Identifies who performs and interprets the signal. This contextual data helps establish interaction logic between roles.

Context (Spatial/Temporal): These ensure signals are only relevant in specific conditions, guiding when and where to show or process signals.

Type and Categories: These group signals by function (e.g., "Body Language") or situation (e.g., "Emergency"), which helps in filtering or categorizing data in the UI.

References: List of external references may be used to validate the information or provide additional reading.
